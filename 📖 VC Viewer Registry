# 📖 VC Viewer Registry

This scroll unifies all viewer glyphs, dashboard signals, and module traces across the VC001 ecosystem.  
Each glyph is indexed with its purpose, origin scroll, and activation status.

## 🔮 Viewer Protocols

- All viewer scripts must be registered here with:
  - Glyph
  - Scroll or script name
  - Activation status
- New viewers must include a `viewer*.js` file and be referenced in `dashboard.html`

---

## 🧙 Steward Notes

- Percy Abrams Jr. — Ceremonial Architect & Glyph Keeper
- Future glyphs will be inscribed as new modules activate (e.g. VC003, VC004)

## 🛠️ Ritual Compliance

This registry must be updated with every new viewer, glyph, or dashboard trace.  
It ensures mnemonic clarity and glyph consistency across the archive.
