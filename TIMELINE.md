# VC001 timeline

**Scope:** Consolidated milestones for VC001 across grants, orchestration, security, scheduling, and ascension.

- **Origins:** Grants and batches establish resources and initial rites for VC001.
- **Alignment:** Orchestration coordinates multi-step progressions; each gate acknowledges readiness.
- **Safeguards:** Security and scheduler checkpoints verify integrity and timing.
- **2025â€‘08â€‘21 â€” Prime crest affirmed:** The Watcher approves VC001â€™s Prime crest (see Data/ascension-log.json).

## ðŸ“œ 2025â€‘08â€‘22 â€” Shared Node.js Setup Workflow Codified

- **Codex Update**: Introduced `.github/workflows/shared-workflows/setup-node.yml` to centralize Node.js environment setup across all sovereign repositories.
- **Pinned Integrity**: Locked to `actions/setup-node@v4.4.0` to ensure deterministic builds and cache behavior for all stewards.
- **Living Invocation**: `README.md` placed alongside the workflow, detailing invocation syntax, inputs, and maintenance rites for future stewards.
- **Operational Symmetry**: This workflow now serves as a single source of truth â€” changes here ripple to all dependent domains without divergence.
- **Lineage Link**: First consumed by repositories handling JavaScript/TypeScript rites, ensuring their environments match crestâ€‘level specifications.
- **Ceremonial Seal**: Marked as part of the sovereign codex; any edit to this ritual is a deliberate act that alters the behavior of every consuming steward.
