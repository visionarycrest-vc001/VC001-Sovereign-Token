# Copilot Instructions for VC001-Sovereign-Token

## Overview
This repository provides ceremonial and operational code packages for Visionary Crest VC001. The codebase is primarily JavaScript, but also contains Shell, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Python, and some other files. It uses npm workspaces and contains multiple packages, including a core package under the scope @visionarycrest-vc001/core.

## General Coding Guidelines
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Use ES6+ syntax. Always run Prettier and ESLint before committing. Maintain modular structure and use semantic variable/function names.
  - Example JSDoc:
    ```js
    /**
     * Returns the sum of two numbers.
     * @param {number} a
     * @param {number} b
     * @returns {number}
     */
    function add(a, b) { ... }
    ```
- **Shell:** Scripts must be POSIX-compliant and include usage comments at the top. Name scripts descriptively.
  - Example header:
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    # Usage: ./deploy.sh [options]
    # Description: Deploys the project to staging.
    ```
- **HTML/CSS:** Ensure semantic HTML and accessible CSS. Follow [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines. Optimize assets.
- **Python:** Comply with PEP8. Use flake8 and black for linting/formatting if Python code grows.

## Formatting and Validation
- All code and docs should be formatted automatically via pre-commit hooks (see [.pre-commit-config.yaml](../.pre-commit-config.yaml)).
- JSON and YAML must pass validation checks.
- Do not add large files unless necessary; prefer Git LFS for binaries.

## Package Management
- Use npm workspaces for multi-package management.
- Declare all dependencies in each package.json. Use "@visionarycrest-vc001/core": "^1.0.0" for shared functionality.
- Remove references to deprecated/non-existent packages (e.g., @vc/core).

## Documentation
- All exported functions/classes require JSDoc or similar docstring descriptions.
- Scripts must include usage and parameter comments.
- Update README.md with any major changes to project structure or usage.

## Workflow & CI/CD
- Commits must pass all pre-commit hooks and CI workflows.
- Fix errors from GitHub Actions, including lint, format, or dependency failures.
- Ensure npm install works after dependency changes. Test workflows on feature branches before merging.
- **Testing:** Use Jest for JS/TS tests (in `__tests__` or `tests/`), PyTest for Python. All new features must include relevant tests and update test documentation.

## Security & Secrets
- Never commit secrets, passwords, API keys, or sensitive config. Use .env files and ensure they are gitignored.
- Use [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or GitHub secret scanning for added protection.
- Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Contribution Process
- All changes should be made via pull requests, not direct pushes.
- PRs must have a clear description and reference related issues when relevant.
- At least one code review is required before merging to main.
- Use provided [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and [ISSUE template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) if available.

## Onboarding & Support
- New contributors: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [README.md](../README.md) for setup instructions.
- For help, open a GitHub Discussion or Issue.

## Critique and Recommendations
- The repo is strong in modularity, formatting, and workflow coverage.
- Add automated tests if not present, and include test instructions here.
- Expand Python/TypeScript guidelines if code in those languages grows.
- Consider accessibility guidelines for HTML/CSS if applicable.
- Provide more examples/templates for common code and documentation patterns.
- Regularly update these instructions as workflows and standards evolve.
