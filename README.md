# Sovereign Archive

A ceremonial, static-first archive: landing (public), watcher (internal), data (truth), and codex (meaning).

## Quickstart
- npm not required; serve apps/* as static.
- Edit data/*.json; landing and watcher reflect updates.
- ./scripts/build.sh then ./scripts/deploy.sh to publish.

## Folders

- apps/watcher — internal dashboard for metrics and queues
- data — vc ledger, glyph overflow, metrics, ascension, recalibration
- codex — protocols, rituals, and glyph meanings
- public/assets — images, glyphs, icons
- templates — nft metadata template
- scripts — build and deploy
