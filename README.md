## VC001: The Sovereign Ascent

> ‚ÄúIn the ledger‚Äôs quiet lines, destinies are written.‚Äù

**Foundation stones:** From its earliest grant and batch entries, VC001 emerged as a sovereign identity in waiting. Early allocations and rites formed the roots of its lineage.

**Orchestrated rise:** Orchestration logs show sequenced actions: systems aligned, signals exchanged, each step dependent on the last‚Äîa symphony of subsystems.

**Guardians & timelocks:** Security and scheduler checkpoints stood vigilant, ensuring ascension could not be rushed; readiness was measured in proof and patience.

**Watcher‚Äôs decree ‚Äî 2025‚Äë08‚Äë21:** Prime crest affirmed for VC001. This wasn‚Äôt cosmetic; it marked elevation into the crest‚Äôs topmost tier.

- **Timeline:** See TIMELINE.md for a narrative of events.
- **Guide:** See ASCENSION_GUIDE.md for crest roles, lifecycle, and validation rules.
