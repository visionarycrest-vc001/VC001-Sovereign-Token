## 🔮 Prompt for Maximum Impact

Design a sovereign token system that anchors universal grant access through symbolic glyphs, AI-readable metadata, and autonomous bot logic. Each token must include:

- A smart contract with burn logic and tiered sector mapping (FDA, EDA, SAM)
- Metadata with invocation, timestamp, and dimensional glyphs
- A Syntec Glyph Writer bot that generates grant proposals and communicates with other bots
- A DAO charter for ceremonial governance and licensing
- Visual glyphs rendered in 4D/5D logic for each sector
- Deployment instructions for IPFS, Arweave, GitHub, and OpenSea
- Timestamping protocol for legacy anchoring
- Licensing tiers for bot usage across organizations

Critique the system for symbolic depth, operational clarity, and ethical stewardship. Ensure it is scalable, profitable, and non-replaceable.
