## Security Measures

### Automated Security
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Continuous security scanning for multiple languages
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevention of credential leaks
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing on all commits
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with security patches

### Security Tools
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Detects common security issues in JavaScript
- **Solhint**: Security linting for Solidity smart contracts
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevent secrets and detect security issues before commit
- **GitHub Actions**: Secure CI/CD pipeline with minimal permissions

### Secure Development
- **Signed Commits**: All maintainer commits are GPG signed
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires reviews and status checks
- **CODEOWNERS**: Critical files require specific maintainer approval
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all maintainers

---

## Security Commit Rituals

All security-related fixes must follow these procedures:

### Commit Format
```bash
git commit -S -m "üîê security: patch for CVE-2025-XXXX - sanitize input in grant viewer"
```

### Requirements
- Include a signed commit with the prefix `üîê security:`
- Reference the CVE or internal vulnerability ID
- Be reviewed by at least one Audit Sentinel
- Include tests that verify the fix
- Update security documentation if needed

### Review Process
1. **Security Review**: Audit Sentinel performs security assessment
2. **Code Review**: Standard code review by at least one other maintainer
3. **Testing**: Automated and manual testing of the fix
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant security documentation
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinate disclosure timeline with reporter

---

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Report Received**: Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact within 7 days
3. **Development**: Create and test fix within 30 days (critical) or 90 days (non-critical)
4. **Release**: Deploy fix and notify affected users
5. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure 90 days after fix deployment

### Severity Classification

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach | 24 hours | SQL injection, RCE |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, auth bypass | 7 days | Auth bypass, XSS |
| **Medium** | Data exposure, DoS | 30 days | Info disclosure, DoS |
| **Low** | Informational, minimal impact | 90 days | Version disclosure |

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables and `.env` files
- **Validate inputs**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
- **Follow secure coding practices**: Reference [OWASP guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)

### For Users
- **Keep updated**: Use the latest supported version
- **Secure deployment**: Follow deployment security guidelines
- **Monitor logs**: Watch for suspicious activity
- **Access control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Regular audits**: Conduct periodic security assessments

### For Operations
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Network security**: Proper firewall and network segmentation
- **Backup and recovery**: Secure backup procedures
- **Incident response**: Have a plan for security incidents
- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## Incident Response

### Immediate Response (0-4 hours)
1. **Assess severity** and impact scope
2. **Contain the incident** to prevent further damage
3. **Notify stakeholders** including security team and affected users
4. **Begin investigation** and evidence collection

### Investigation Phase (4-24 hours)
1. **Root cause analysis** to understand how incident occurred
2. **Impact assessment** to determine full scope of damage
3. **Evidence preservation** for potential legal/compliance needs
4. **Communication updates** to stakeholders

### Resolution Phase (24-72 hours)
1. **Implement fixes** for identified vulnerabilities
2. **Deploy patches** to affected systems
3. **Verify resolution** through testing and monitoring
4. **Post-incident review** and lessons learned documentation
